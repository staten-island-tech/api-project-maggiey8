THIS IS THE IDEA !!!

POKEMON --> COLOR THEMES

--> CREATE AN EXAMPLE SITE (multiple?)
--> YEAHHHHH POKEMON !!!!!!!

except how do you
color pick from the data
oh well

---> CHANGEABLE COLOR SQUARE !!!!
(if it looks ugly)


> search pokemon
> collect major colors (go thru each pixel(?) and count them, pick the ones that appear the most (5) + have other color options)
> default main, secondary, accent color
> option to change theme n stuff (if shiny, button WOW !!!!)
> filterable by main color (how do i do that ????) + multi (maybe filter by type, gen, SHINY) THEY DO IT FOR ME !!!
